# Arduino Car using IR Remote!

Made a remote control car using IR receivers to control the movement of the vehicle.

Programmed LED's to be used as turn signals in the car. 

I had to use non-polarized capicators in person as the DC motors give off electrical noise that was interfering with my IR Reciever.
