# Arduino Car using IR Remote!

Made a remote control car using IR receivers to control the movement of the vehicle.

Circuit was orginally planned using TinkerCAD, and was later built in person.

I had to use non-polarized capicators in person as the DC motors give off electrical noise that was interfering with my IR Reciever.
